Dr. Ajaz Ahmad Bhat leads research in cognitive robotics, AI, and brain-inspired computing systems. His work focuses on developing intelligent robots that can learn, reason, and adapt like biological systems.

He is currently an Assistant Professor of Intelligent Robotics at the Faculty of Digital Science, Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Brunei, and a visiting researcher at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, Japan. Prior to this posting, he worked as a Senior Research Associate at the University of East Anglia, UK, and then as an Assistant Professor at the University of Twente, Netherlands.

### Biography

Ajaz’s research interests lie at the intersection of intelligent robotics, cognitive sciences, and consumer technologies with a special focus on understanding and designing developmental and cumulative learning systems. His research outputs have been published in more than 15 journal articles with some of them in top-tier journals such as *Psychological Review* and *Autonomous Robots*. His work on Causal Learning in Robots was covered in top conferences like ICML and by media outlets such as BBC. He has been involved in multiple international research projects such as EU’s FP7 DARWIN and NIH’s WOLVES. Ajaz retains memberships of both IEEE and APS societies in addition to holding a Ph.D. in Cognitive Robotics from the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Italy.
