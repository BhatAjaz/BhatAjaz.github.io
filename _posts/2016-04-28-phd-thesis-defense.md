Major milestone achieved! Successfully defended PhD thesis on brain-inspired memory architectures for cognitive robotics.

## Thesis Overview

**"Towards a Brainlike Memory for Cognitive Robots"**

The central premise of the thesis is that **cognition is constructive manipulation of memory**. Based on this principle, it proposes a novel brain-guided perspective on the design of cognitive architectures for cumulatively developing systems.

## Key Contributions

### Theoretical Framework
- Brain-inspired memory architectures for robots
- Constructive manipulation of memory as the foundation of cognition
- Principled framework for cumulative learning

### Experimental Validation
The framework was validated through several experiments from animal and infant cognition reenacted on the iCub humanoid robot:
- Learning of actions and motor skills
- Affordance discovery and learning
- Cause-effect relationship understanding
- Multi-modal sensory integration

### Cumulative Development
The thesis demonstrates how robots can achieve cumulative learning across multiple cognitive domains, building increasingly sophisticated behavioral repertoires over time.

## Impact

This work establishes foundational principles for designing cognitive robots that can learn and develop in human-like ways, with memory systems that support both storage and creative recombination of experiences.
