## 📚 Research Highlights

Back from IEEE BIGDATA 2025, where I presented **two papers first-authored by Haji Gul** and contributed as a session chair for *LLM-Enhanced Scientific and Graph Intelligence*.

The presented work explored how **large language models (LLMs)** can be integrated with structured scientific data and graph-based reasoning frameworks — pushing toward more explainable, domain-aware AI systems. The session brought together researchers working at the intersection of:

* LLMs for scientific discovery
* Graph intelligence and knowledge representation
* Hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches
* Scalable data-driven AI systems

Chairing the session provided a valuable vantage point on how quickly LLM-based research is evolving — particularly in structured and scientific domains.

## 🤝 Conversations & Collaborations

One of the most rewarding parts of the conference was the opportunity for meaningful discussions with researchers including:

* Chi Heem
* Sanjay Madria
* Karthik Ramasamy
* Keun Soo Yim

along with Prof. Ansari, Muteb, and many others.

These conversations ranged from graph-based reasoning pipelines to real-world AI deployment challenges. Hoping some of these exchanges grow into collaborative research and practical implementations.

## 🎓 Growing Interest in AI Research

It was encouraging to see many bachelor’s and master’s students actively engaging with AI research at the conference. The pipeline of young researchers entering AI and data science continues to strengthen globally.

For those considering a **PhD at UBD**, applications open in January. If you’re interested in AI, graph intelligence, robotics, or LLM-driven systems, feel free to reach out.

## 🌃 Macau Reflections

Beyond the conference halls, Macau itself was a memorable surprise. The blend of Chinese and Portuguese heritage, vibrant night views, Taipa’s streets, and fireworks created a unique atmosphere. Grateful to Chi for the city walk and for introducing local food spots I would not have discovered on my own.

## 🌟 Personal Notes

Conferences like IEEE BIGDATA reaffirm the importance of global research dialogue — not just presenting results, but building networks that transform ideas into sustained collaboration.

Proud to represent the **School of Digital Science (SDS), UBD**, and excited about the research directions emerging from this trip.
