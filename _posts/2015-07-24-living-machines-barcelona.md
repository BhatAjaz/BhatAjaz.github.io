Presented groundbreaking work in beautiful Barcelona at the Living Machines Conference 2015, showcasing how iCub learns tool use through imitation learning.

## Conference Presentation

**"How iCub Learns to Imitate Use of a Tool by Recycling the Past Knowledge Learnt During Drawing"**

The presentation took place in Gaudi's stunning city of Barcelona, demonstrating the intersection of biological inspiration and robotic learning.

## Research Innovation

### Tool Learning through Knowledge Transfer
- iCub humanoid robot learns to use tools by building upon previously acquired drawing skills
- Demonstrates knowledge recycling and transfer learning principles
- Shows how past experiences can be creatively repurposed for new tasks

### Imitation Learning Framework
- Teacher demonstration of tool use actions
- Robot observation and skill extraction
- Adaptive application to novel tool-use scenarios

### Biological Inspiration
The approach mirrors how biological systems build upon existing motor patterns to acquire new skills, showing cumulative learning in action.

## Technical Achievement

This work represents a significant advancement in:
- Embodied artificial intelligence
- Developmental robotics
- Bio-inspired learning systems
- Tool use cognition in artificial agents

The research demonstrates that sophisticated cognitive abilities can emerge through the creative combination and adaptation of simpler learned behaviors.
