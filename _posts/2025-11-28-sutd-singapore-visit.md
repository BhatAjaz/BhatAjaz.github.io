## 🎯 Visit summary

This week Dr Hong and I dropped by the lab run by Rajesh Elara Mohan to see their work in mobile-robot design and spin-off activity. The lab’s engineering strength in mobile robotics was immediately evident, but what really stood out was the breadth of real-world applications and the number of spin-off companies emerging from that research. The team has also been active in taking robotics into schools across Asia through their global competition, RoboRoarZ. ([LinkedIn][1])

## 🔬 Technical & translational highlights

* Strong focus on **mobile-robot design** with clear emphasis on field-ready prototypes and demonstrators.
* Active translation pipeline: R&D → prototyping → industry partnerships → commercialization.
* Outreach & education: an organised competition (RoboRoarZ) that brings robotics into school curricula across the region.

The role of the National Robotics Programme appears vital — providing funding for R&D and prototyping and connecting the lab with industry partners to help commercialize ideas. ([LinkedIn][1])

## 🤝 Thanks & connections

Big thanks to Yu Ling for being an excellent host and walking us through the projects, and to the researchers who shared demos up close. Thanks also to Dr Hong for planning the visit and for capturing some great shots. The lab's work ties academic research, national programmes, and school outreach — a neat example of research-to-impact in action.

## 🌟 Personal notes

Visiting the lab was a great reminder of how focused engineering, coupled with structured support (R&D funding, prototyping help, industry links), can accelerate both innovation and real-world impact. Proud to see initiatives that connect universities with schools and industry — exactly the sort of ecosystem-building the region needs.
