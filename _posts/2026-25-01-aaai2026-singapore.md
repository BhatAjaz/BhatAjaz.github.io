## 🎯 Quick summary

Kicked off the year at AAAI-26 in Singapore — loved presenting our work on **knowledge graph model evaluation** and soaking up the incredible energy across technical talks, demos and posters. The poster sessions at *Graphs for Learning & Reasoning* and *Neuro for AI* workshops were especially engaging: great questions, sharp feedback, and a number of promising conversations with early-career researchers and practitioners.

AAAI-26 is a large, multi-track meeting: in addition to main conference, the program included tutorials, numerous workshops and demonstration sessions, and special bridge programs — all designed to accelerate cross-disciplinary AI work.

## 🔍 What made AAAI-26 notable (quick points)

* **Scale & breadth:** AAAI-26 ran a wide set of workshops (dozens across AI subfields), creating many focused communities-of-practice for topics from logic & AI to multi-agent and LLM-driven systems. 
* **Neuro ↔ AI crossovers:** The *Neuro for AI & AI for Neuro* workshop convened researchers from computational neuroscience, neuromorphic engineering and ML — a clear sign that multimodal and biologically inspired approaches are gaining traction. (neuroai-multimodal-workshop.github.io)

## 🤝 Connections & highlights

Presented our poster on knowledge-graph model evaluation and attended lively sessions at the *Graphs for Learning & Reasoning* and *Neuro for AI* workshops. Loved meeting many curious students and researchers — several conversations look likely to lead to follow-up experiments and collaborations.

Special kudos to Haji Gul for conducting the work and for an excellent poster design.

## 🌟 Personal notes

Conferences like AAAI are energising because they mix deep technical exchange with serendipity — informal chats that seed longer collaborations. Thanks everyone who stopped by our poster. Already looking forward to turning many of the conference ideas into follow-up projects.
