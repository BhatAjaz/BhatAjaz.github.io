Article published in Physics of Life Reviews: "Muscle-less motor synergies and actions without movements. From motor neuroscience to embodied cognition." This work bridges neuroscience and robotics, exploring how motor control principles can inform cognitive robotics and embodied AI systems.

## Research Overview

This groundbreaking research explores the fascinating concept of motor synergies that exist independently of physical muscle activation, bridging the gap between neuroscience understanding and robotic implementation.

## Key Concepts

### Muscle-less Motor Synergies
The research investigates how:

- Motor patterns can exist at the neural level without muscle activation
- Cognitive planning involves motor simulation without movement
- Abstract motor concepts influence decision-making and reasoning
- Neural motor representations inform cognitive processes

### Actions Without Movements
The study examines:

- Mental simulation of actions and their cognitive effects
- How imagined actions influence real behavior
- The role of motor imagery in learning and planning
- Neural mechanisms underlying action simulation
