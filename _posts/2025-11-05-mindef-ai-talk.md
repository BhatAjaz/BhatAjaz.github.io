## 🧭 Talk Summary

My talk, *“AI in Defence — From Awareness to Operational Advantage,”* presented current research from the **School of Digital Science (SDS)**, focusing on how AI can strengthen situational awareness, decision-making, and operational agility.

Highlighted projects from our lab included:

- **Military Camouflage Target Detection** — leveraging multimodal AI to enhance visibility of concealed objects and personnel under realistic field environments.  
- **Personnel-to-Mission Optimization via Link Prediction** — using graph-based AI to map skills, roles, and operational requirements for more effective mission planning.  
- Broader AI-enabled capabilities that support defence readiness, including prediction pipelines, anomaly detection, and decision-support systems.

The talk positioned AI not merely as a tool for automation, but as a **strategic enabler** for future defence capabilities.
