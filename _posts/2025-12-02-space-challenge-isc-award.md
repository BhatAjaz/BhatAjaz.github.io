## 🚀 Achievement Overview

Our Team **UBD02** won the **Merit Award (Advanced Category)** at the **International Space Challenge 2025**, held as part of the Expand Space event in Singapore.

The project, **“Reinforcement Learning for Space Debris Avoidance and Capture,”** explored the use of AI to enable satellites to autonomously navigate crowded orbits — avoiding debris while identifying and capturing key fragments with minimal human intervention. The work demonstrated how reinforcement learning can support safer and more sustainable space operations.

## 🌍 Why This Matters

Space debris is an increasingly critical challenge for satellite operations. AI-driven autonomy — particularly reinforcement learning — offers promising pathways toward:

* Safer satellite navigation
* Reduced reliance on ground-based control
* Sustainable space-environment management

This recognition at ISC 2025 underscores the importance of nurturing AI talent capable of addressing global technological challenges.
