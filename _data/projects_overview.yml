overview: "Reverse-engineering natural intelligence and designing artificial cognitive agents that act like (and alongside) natural agents, form the long-term goals of my research. I tread an interdisciplinary path connecting intelligent robotics, cognitive sciences and consumable AI technologies to investigate learning, memory, language and intelligence in cumulatively developing systems (humans and robots). Looking at intelligence from a holistic perspective and cognitive agents as integrated systems has led me investigate problems across multiple subdomains, particularly the ones listed below."
