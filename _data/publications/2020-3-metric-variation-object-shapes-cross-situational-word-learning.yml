abstract: "Cross-situational word learning (CSWL) requires tracking word–object co-occurrence across ambiguous naming scenarios to infer correct mappings. Prior work shows eye movements reflect learning success but may be influenced by object properties. This experiment will systematically vary object shape and colour distances on each trial—'Near' (similar) versus 'Far' (distinct)—while controlling stimulus pairs. Eye-tracking and forced-choice naming tests will assess how metric variation affects real-time attention and word‐learning accuracy."
methodology: "Adult participants complete CSWL trials in a within-subjects design. On each trial, two novel objects appear with a novel label; object pairs are manipulated to be similar ('Near') or distinct ('Far') in shape or colour. Eye movements are recorded to track referent selection. After training, forced-choice tests measure word–object mapping accuracy. Statistical analyses compare learning across Near vs. Far conditions and correlate gaze durations with performance."
