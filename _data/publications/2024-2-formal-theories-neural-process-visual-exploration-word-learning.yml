abstract: "Visual exploration and auditory processing interact to support object discrimination, categorization, and early word learning. To clarify their complex, multi‐timescale interactions, we generalize a formal neural process model of word learning to simulate two infant studies of label‐driven novelty preference (9–22 months). Simulations explain label effects on looking and mutual‐exclusivity responses. We discuss criteria for formal theories and their integration with empirical paradigms."
methodology: "The WOLVES dynamic neural process model was extended to simulate 9–22‐month‐olds' novelty‐driven looking paradigms. Parameter settings for memory consolidation and attention dynamics were adjusted to match two empirical datasets. Model predictions of looking‐time curves and exclusivity choices were compared to published infant data. Goodness‐of‐fit was assessed via mean squared error and Akaike information criterion."
