abstract: "In an industrial assembly task, two robots share workspace to assemble fuse-boxes. We describe coupled forward models of body and peripersonal space learned via exploration. Internal simulation evaluates action-consequence pairs, driving cooperative sequences even when solo goals are unachievable."
methodology: "Each robot's body schema and peripersonal space are learned via self-organized map clustering. During run-time, action candidates are simulated in the forward model, scored by task reward. A shared planner sequences individual goals into cooperative behaviors."
