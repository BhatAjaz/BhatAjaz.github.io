## Abstract

This article is a formal reply to commentary on the original \"Muscleless motor synergies\" review. It clarifies theoretical points, addresses criticisms about internal model accuracy and synergy versus control distinctions, and elaborates on internal simulation constraints, but does not present new empirical methods.
No abstract provided.
