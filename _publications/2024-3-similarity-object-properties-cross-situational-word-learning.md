## Abstract

Context manipulations reveal that similarity in object properties can counterintuitively facilitate word learning. Using the WOLVES dynamic field model, we simulated CSWL under two conditions: 'NEAR' (objects metrically similar) and 'FAR' (objects distinct). WOLVES predicted superior learning in NEAR trials. An adult behavioral experiment confirmed this novel prediction, demonstrating that contextual similarity enhances cross‐situational word mapping.
## Methodology

Adult participants (n=40) completed a CSWL task with 48 trials. On each trial, two objects differed either minimally (NEAR) or maximally (FAR) in colour or shape and were paired with a novel word. Eye‐tracking recorded fixations during training; forced‐choice tests measured mapping accuracy. The WOLVES model was parameterized to human gaze and accuracy data. Learning rates across conditions were compared using mixed‐effects logistic regression.
