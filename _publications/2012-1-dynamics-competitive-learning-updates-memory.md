## Abstract

We analyze how parallel versus sequential updating and synaptic memory affect phases of consensus and polarization in a competitive learning model. The phase diagram exhibits ordered and disordered regimes, with critical exponents matching the voter model universality class.

## Methodology

We study a two-strategy spin-like model on a lattice, applying all combinations of parallel and sequential updates. Success rates over a memory window govern strategy updates. Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling determine phase boundaries and critical behavior.
