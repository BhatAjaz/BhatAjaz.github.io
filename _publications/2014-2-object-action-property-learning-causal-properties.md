## Abstract

We explore how robots can discover which object properties drive task outcomes by cumulatively interacting with objects varying along multiple dimensions. Through a dynamic neural field model, robots infer causally dominant properties from exploration data without supervision.
## Methodology

A dynamic field theory-based architecture tracks instantaneous perceptual activations and integrates them across trials. Simulations and real‐robot trials show that the system correctly identifies weight or shape as the critical dimension for floating tasks.
We explore how robots can discover which object properties drive task outcomes by cumulatively interacting with objects varying along multiple dimensions. Through a dynamic neural field model, robots infer causally dominant properties from exploration data without supervision.
